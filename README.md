BizFeed
======
An online plateform what provide feedbacks of limited distribution of videos through Face Recognition and Sentiment Analysis.

Project developed for GSUHACK-SPRING2017

Motivation
------
Schools, orgnizations and large bussiness are composed of various departments and students/employees in each department require different trainings. Transfering to another area may require redundant training and sometimes training video quality is very poor and employees are reluctant to provide feedbacks. BizFeed allows orgs to manage all their training videos in one place, and providing feedbacks about how users responses while watching the video, reflecting the quality of video through concentration and sentiment analysis with face recognition technology.

BizFeed can also be an useful tool for independent film/video makers to gather more accurate feedbacks with less bias through technology, and controling limited distribution of the video.

Accounts are orgnization based, and anyone else/regular users are invitation only through the orgnization. Video clips can be uploaded, managed, and assigned to specific users/user-groups by admin. Real-time data will be collected when user is watching the video, and stored in db for further analysis. Admin can make sure each user finished watching all required videos and can view analysis on each clips, which may provide useful feedbacks for future imporovements.
